TODO

- allow user to specify the number of layers (or a range of allowed
  numbers) for the generated image.
- make implementation more nodejs Stream-like, perhaps?
- retina support in web version (images at higher dpi)
- give finer control over layers, etc., and reproducible config
- Make cloud-layer generator infinitely fine-grained (seeded/replayable
  PRNG?)
- Make various constants in starfish.js more configurable (via args to
  Instance construction? Directly settable in Starfish object?)
